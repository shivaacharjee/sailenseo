They enhance your search listing, making it more enticing for users to click on and easier for search engines to extract information.Adding Rich Snippets to your site won’t affect the appearance or content of your pages; rather, everything is done behind the scenes in your site’s HTML code. To display Rich Snippets, you just need to tweak the code of your website with some additional tags.
